Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This problem seems to be a while loop which runs as long as a is less than n to the power of 3. A is also incrementing up by n to the power of 2. So for example, if n is 8, the loop will increment from 0 to 4, then to 8, which is 2 to the third. This is 2 operations for a value n of 2. So the time complexity is O(n). The space complexity should be O(1), as it is only allocating memory to the a variable.

b) This problem has 4 for loops, all nested within one another. The first time runs from 0 to n. So the minimum runtime is already O(n). The loop nested inside runs from the i index + 1 all the way to n. So the first iteration runs from 1 to n, the second from 2 to n, and so on. Since it isn't running the full length of n every time, it isn't quite O(n^2) yet but it is close. The next loop runs with every iteration of the previous loop, starting from j+1, which starts at i+1, and going to n. So the first index is 2, and it goes up by 1 each time. We are probably well into O(n^2) territory now since these loops are nested. The final loop does the same, starting from k + 1, which starts at j+1, which starts at i+1. So this final loop starts at 3, and runs 10 times for each iteration of the previous loop. The runtime is somewhere around O(n^3). Full for loop (n) * for loop which runs at length n-1 decreasing by 1 with each iteration of the previous loop * for loop which runs at length n-2 decreasing by with each iteration of previous * for loop which runs exactly 10 times with each iteration of previous loop. So I suppose it's n * nlogn * nlogn * 10. Dropping the coefficients this should resolve to just O(nlogn). The space complexity should be O(1), as it is only allocating memory to a handful of integer variables. Edit after what we talked about: Hmm ... maybe I wasn't totally off and it really is n * nlogn * nlogn * 10, the 10 cancels out and the n multiplies with the n coefficients in the nlogn's, so it could be something like n^3 * logn? And the n^3 takes priority so the final result is O(n^3).

c) This problem starts at input n and runs recursively, calling itself one time per recursive call and decrementing n by 1, all the way down to 0. So this should resolve to O(n) time complexity, and O(n) space complexity.

## Exercise 2

a) If we want to be as time-efficient as possible, it seems like using a variation of a binary-search algorithm would be the best option. Why? Well, we know f exists as a value, and we have n floors. That means the values within n are "sorted", as they increment consecutively from floor 0 to floor n. We can start off by dividing n by 2, and dropping an egg from there. It will probably break. We can then discard the values larger than n/2, and divide by 2 again to drop another egg. If it breaks, we discard values greater than n/2/2, and keep dividing. When it finally doesn't break, we do not discard the remaining floors, and instead just increment up 1 by 1 until dropping an egg breaks again. The first floor we get to that resumes being high enough to break the egg will be f, so our final answer will be that floor. This should resolve to O(logn) time complexity, and O(1) space complexity (if done iteratively). If done recursively, then the space complexity would also be O(logn).
